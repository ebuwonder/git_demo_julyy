            <h2>Do Fitness Apps Actually Do Anything?</h2>
            <p>In an age where fast food joints are making food that’s
              unhealthier and less expensive than ever before, Lyfts
              cart us everywhere we go and Netflix makes sitting on
              our asses easier than getting up and going
              outside, getting fit and staying in shape have never been so
              difficult. It’s no secret that the world’s population is getting
               fatter and that people are exercising less, and tech companies
               would be remiss not to at least take note of this. So, with the
               influx of self-driving cars and revolutionary smart phones and
               VR headsets, someone, somewhere along the way
              had the idea that we could be doing more with technology and
              fitness.Everyone from Tim Cook to celebrity fitness trainers and
               major brands are buying into the hype and using them, and it seems
               like there’s another new fitness app or piece of fitness tech being
                released every single day. But, do they work? </p>
